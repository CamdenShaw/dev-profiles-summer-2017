                    <h2>my life before RED</h2>
                    <p>My hometown: Hong Kong</p>
                    <p>Before I enrolled at RED, I was working as a full time UI/UX designer for 2 years. 
                    I designed and created new interfaces, drew new wireframes and mockups, reserched on the user needs and
                    continuously improved design and usability qualities for mobile apps. 
                    Before that, I worked as a graphic designer in a printed media company for 1 years.
                    Currently, I am still working as a freelance graphic designer, doing magazines and posters design.</p>

                    <h2>interesting fact about me</h2>
                    <p>I have a Bachelor degree in Finance from Simon Fraser University. 
                    I never thought of being a designer or developer during my high school life.
                    However, I got an opportunity to work as a graphic designer several years ago. 
                    I realized I love designing, looking at various moblie apps, building mockups and prototypes. 
                    It started my passion to be an UI/UX designer and even to be a front-end developer.</p>

                    <h2>my best travel experience</h2>
                    <p>One of my best travel experience was my post-graduation trip to Orlando, Florida. No more finals! No more homeworks! 
                    My schoolmates and I planned the whole trip by ourselves. 
                    None of us have been there. It was an adventure for all of us too.
                    Eight of us took an 8 hours flight from Vancouver to Orlando. It didn't have any direct flights at that time. 
                    Even though, the flight was long, it was worth it because Orlando is a magical place.
                    We went to Walt Disney World, the largest theme park in the world as well as Universal Studios Florida, I am a big fan of Harry Potter.
                    We went to the beaches, tried many different food and had a lot of fun. Travelling doesn't have to be expensive, what is most important is
                    the poeple you travel with that makes most different.</p>
