                        <p class="paragraphs">I traveled across Canada from Parry Sound, Ontario to Thunder Bay to Toronto to Vancouver.</p>
                        <h2 class='commonH'>Work Work Work</h2>
                        <p class="paragraphs">Before I decided to completely change up my work, I was traveling all over BC to make TV commercials.  I worked on lots of big name products from car commercials to carpet cleaners, all of which I signed an NDA for so I can't tell you specifically which ones unless I have nice things to say about them.  So I'm not going to tell you which ones.</p>
                        <h2 class='commonH'>Travel</h2>
                        <p class="paragraphs">I haven't traveled a whole lot, not having a lot of free-time to pursue my interests is one of the reasons why I want a change of career.  One trip I did take, though, was to Panama, Panama, Panama for a wedding.  It was a blast!  If you ever go to Panama I highly recomend you take a detour to San Blas.  It is paradise!</p>

                        <p class="paragraphs">I play guitar.  I suppose that is the most interesting thing about me.  I'm no rockstar.  Nor folkstar.  Nor popstar.  Basically I'm no good, however it <b>is</b> interesting that I play.  Sort of.  I mean 90% of people who play an instrument play the guitar.</p>
                        <h2 class='commonH'>My Sercret</h2>
                        <p class="paragraphs">I prefer composing, which could be considered my secret talent.  I don't share my compositions with people as much as my guitar playing.  You can find a link to my latest, unfinished compostition <a href="https://soundcloud.com/camden-shaw-395038776/inside-my-head/s-WHoMR" target="_blank

                        <h2 class='commonH'>What I Saw in the Crystal Ball</h2>
                        <p class="paragraphs">After the program I plan to spend two years back in my hometown building my portfolio with the smaller businesses there and to be close to my family that I have barely seen the past ten years.  After the two years in Parry Sound I will reassess my situation and either move back to BC and look for a job with a company, return to school to learn even more coding or, if my digital empire has grown large enough from Parry Sound, move to wherever in the world I feel like and kick it on the beach drinking margaritas while writing code.</p>
                        <h2 class='commonH'>One More Thing</h2>
                        <p class="paragraphs">  My last 'fun fact' that I will share is that I have a dog.  Her name is Betsy.  She is awesome.</p>
