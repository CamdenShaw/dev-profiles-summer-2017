                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p><strong>Hometowm:</strong> Jakarta, Indonesia</p>
                    <p>
                        Before I enrolled to REDAcademy, I was working as a Front-End Developer. I was mostly in charge in
                        designing and creating UI for the platform.

                    <h2>Interesting Fact</h2>
                    <p>
                        An interesting fact about me is that I am an avid fan of Real Madrid C.F. I have followed them
                        since 2002 and watch almost all their games every season.

                    <h2>Best Travel Experience</h2>
                    <p>
                        All my travels have been an awesome experience, but if I were to choose one, it would be a trip with my entire family to Las Vegas.
                        We had a wonderful time in Las Vegas, walking down the Las Vegas strip and visiting the different amazing hotels. And of course, winning some
                        money from the slot machines.
