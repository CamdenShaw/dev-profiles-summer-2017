                    <h2>Life Before <span id="red">RED</span></h2>

                    <p>Hometown: Vancouver BC Canada</p>
                    <p>
                        What can I say, the good ol' quarter life crises *sob* Went from selling clothes to cars 
                        to collectibles to working in a restaurant to delivering auto parts. Then started my own garage where I did 
                        cosmetic upgrades, installations, and simple fixes for cars, some of the most 
                        amazing experiences I've had came during this time. Then finally my most recent job, 
                        part-time at a bank. In studies I went from a marketing 
                        major to computer sciences, to software development, and now I'm here at 
                        RED where I will make my next milestone move.
